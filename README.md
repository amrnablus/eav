# EAV

This is an EAV (Entity-attribute-value) implementation in java. It's still in the very early stages

What's done so far:
* Database design using mysql
* JPA entity implementation
* Sample service

TBD:
* Complete the services
* Create an index on top of the plain queries
* Caching
* Support other backends.
